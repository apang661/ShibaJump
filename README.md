# Doge Jump

## Proposal

*Doge Jump* is a platform game where the player progresses through a vertical screen, 
obtaining power-ups and defeating enemies in their path. The game will include:
- A home screen that allows for character selection
- The option to save the player's progress
- Player controls using the spacebar and left/right arrow keys

This game is made for entertainment purposes. I chose to create this program as I've always wanted to make a game,
and I feel that it will be challenging and complex enough for me to become more proficient in Java.

## User Stories

Here are four user stories that describe features that should be added in Phase 1:
- As a user, I want to be able to enter, change, and view my username.
- As a user, I want to be able to select and view different characters.
- As a user, I want to be able to check my amount of DogePoints (User cannot earn DogePoints as of now).
- As a user, I want to be able to add enemies to the list of enemies encountered.
