# Shiba Jump


*Shiba Jump* is a platform game where the player progresses through a vertical screen, 
obtaining power-ups and defeating enemies in their path. The game will include:
- A home screen that allows for character selection
- The option to save the player's progress
- Player controls using the keyboard

This game is made for entertainment purposes. I chose to create this program as I've always wanted to make a game,
and I feel that this will be challenging as a first project and complex enough for me to learn more about Java.

### Controls
- Press A and D to move left and right
- Press K to shoot projectiles
- Press P to pause the game
